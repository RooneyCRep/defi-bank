# defi-bank
A test dapp for the Ethereum protocol utilizing decentralized lending and loans for users.

Please note that this is a test dapp and is not audited or optimized and may not function as intended deployed to the Ethereum Mainnet. I am not liable for improper usage of this project. 

This project utilizes solidity smart contracts for the backend, the front end will most likely utilise javascript.
